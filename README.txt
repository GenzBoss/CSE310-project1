This directory contains 3 files aside from this README.txt file:
1) sea.txt
2) pre-sea.txt
3) encoded-sea.txt

The purpose is to provide the input to and output from the preprocess and "encode" executables for Project #1.

The first file, sea.txt, is the example input used in the video for Project #1.
Executing the command:

% preprocess <sea.txt >pre-sea.txt

produces redirects stdin from sea.txt and stdout to the file pre-sea.txt.  The output file contains the output of the preprocessing algorithm on the input in sea.txt.

Executing the command:

% encode pre-sea.txt insertion <sea.txt >encoded-sea.txt

As you can see, it takes two command line parameters.  The first is the name of a file containing the output of the preprocessing algorithm on the input to the encoder; in this example the file named pre-sea.txt contains this output for the input in sea.txt (notice the same input is fed to each command).  

The second command line parameter is a keyword: either "insertion" or "merge".  For the milestone deadline you only need to support sorting using the Insertion Sort algorithm.

Stdin is redirected from the file sea.txt; this is the text to encode using the encoding algorithm.  Besides the encoded text, it also contains a "summary" of the encoding of the symbols in the text. The output is written to stdout, here redirected to the file encoded-sea.txt.

This output has been generated by hand but should conform to what I did in the video and what your programs should produce.  Please report discrepancies in the project description and this output to Ed Discussion.
